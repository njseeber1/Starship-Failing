   Alexandra was waking up. She heard the familiar hiss of her pod disengaging, groggily forced her eyes open, and felt a blast of warm, humid air rush into her cryo chamber. she tried to rub her face, but her arms weren't working yet.
   She was immediately excited, were her parents back? This was not her first time going into cryo sleep, and she felt as though it was longer this time
    Her vision was foggy, and she had a hard time discerning what was on the other side of the cryo chambers frost coated glass. There was definitely some motion.
